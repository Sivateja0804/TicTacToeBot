# Project TicTacToeBot
A generalized NxN Tic Tac Toe bot where you can play with grid 3x3-12x12

To do:
Planning to deploy a Pretrained model \
Major steps in the project: 
1. Reducing time complexity using MinMax Algorithm:
    i)2^144- steps. (db)
    ii) db calls

2. Implement on the go training model
    i)Legal moves optimization
    ii)alpha, beta pruning- 5,6,7,8,9
    iii)Dynamic programming

3. Compare and evaluate Min max vs other algorithms

4. ML Model
